**cryptedForeignKeys** | [**Map<String, Set<DelegationDto>>**](Set.md) | The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship).

**delegations** | [**Map<String, Set<DelegationDto>>**](Set.md) | When a document is created, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (never to be used for something else than referencing from other entities).

**encryptionKeys** | [**Map<String, Set<DelegationDto>>**](Set.md) | When a document needs to be encrypted, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (different from the delegation key, never to appear in clear anywhere in the db. He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation | [default to const {}]
**encryptedSelf** | **String** | The base64 encoded data of this object, formatted as JSON and encrypted in AES using the random master key from encryptionKeys. | [optional]
**medicalLocationId** | **String** | The id of the medical location where this entity was created. | [optional]
