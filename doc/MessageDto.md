**tags** | [**Set<CodeStubDto>**](CodeStubDto.md) | A tag is an item from a codification system that qualifies an entity as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the tag qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the tag will always apply. For example, the label of a field is qualified using a tag. LOINC is a codification system typically used for tags. | [default to const {}]
**codes** | [**Set<CodeStubDto>**](CodeStubDto.md) | A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes | [default to const {}]
**endOfLife** | **int** | Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object. | [optional]
**deletionDate** | **int** | hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object. Filled automatically when deletePatient is called. | [optional]
**fromAddress** | **String** | Address of the sender of the message | [optional]
**fromHealthcarePartyId** | **String** | ID of the healthcare party sending the message | [optional]
**formId** | **String** |  | [optional]
**status** | **int** | Status of the message | [optional]
**recipientsType** | **String** | The type of user who is the recipient of this message | [optional]
**recipients** | **Set<String>** | List of IDs of healthcare parties to whom the message is addressed | [default to const {}]
**toAddresses** | **Set<String>** | The address of the recipient of the message. Format is of an email address with extra domains defined for mycarenet and ehealth: (efact.mycarenet.be/eattest.mycarenet.be/chapter4.mycarenet.be/ehbox.ehealth.fgov.be) | [default to const {}]
**received** | **int** | The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) when the message was received | [optional]

**metas** | **Map<String, String>** |  | [default to const {}]
**readStatus** | [**Map<String, MessageReadStatusDto>**](MessageReadStatusDto.md) | Status showing whether the message is read or not and the time of reading | [default to const {}]
**transportGuid** | **String** |  | [optional]
**remark** | **String** |  | [optional]
**conversationGuid** | **String** |  | [optional]
**subject** | **String** | Subject for the message | [optional]

**senderReferences** | **Map<String, String>** |  | [default to const {}]
**secretForeignKeys** | **Set<String>** | The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship).

**cryptedForeignKeys** | [**Map<String, Set<DelegationDto>>**](Set.md) | The secretForeignKeys are filled at the to many end of a one to many relationship (for example inside Contact for the Patient -> Contacts relationship). Used when we want to find the patient for a specific contact. These keys are the encrypted id (using the hcParty key for the delegate) that can be found in clear inside the patient. ids encrypted using the hcParty keys. | [default to const {}]
**delegations** | [**Map<String, Set<DelegationDto>>**](Set.md) | When a document is created, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (never to be used for something else than referencing from other entities). He/she encrypts it using his own AES exchange key and stores it as a delegation. The responsible is thus always in the delegations as well | [default to const {}]
**encryptionKeys** | [**Map<String, Set<DelegationDto>>**](Set.md) | When a document needs to be encrypted, the responsible generates a cryptographically random master key (different from the delegation key, never to appear in clear anywhere in the db.
